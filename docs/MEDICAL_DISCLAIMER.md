## IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE USING PNEUMOSCAN

PneumoScan is an **educational and research tool** for demonstrating artificial intelligence applications in medical imaging analysis. This software is **NOT** intended for clinical use.

---

## ⚠️ Not a Medical Device

**PneumoScan is NOT:**

- ❌ A medical device
- ❌ FDA approved or cleared
- ❌ Clinically validated for diagnostic use
- ❌ CE marked for medical use
- ❌ A substitute for professional medical diagnosis
- ❌ Intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease
- ❌ A replacement for radiologist interpretation
- ❌ Suitable for emergency medical decisions

---

## Educational & Research Purpose Only

PneumoScan is designed EXCLUSIVELY for:

- ✅ Educational demonstrations of AI/ML in healthcare
- ✅ Academic research and study
- ✅ Learning about computer vision and deep learning
- ✅ Portfolio and demonstration purposes
- ✅ Non-clinical experimentation
- ✅ Technology evaluation in controlled environments

---

## Limitations & Risks

### Model Limitations

1. **Accuracy is Not Perfect**: The model achieves ~90% accuracy on test data, meaning:
   - It will make incorrect predictions
   - False positives (incorrectly identifying normal X-rays as pneumonia)
   - False negatives (missing actual pneumonia cases)

2. **Limited Training Data**: The model was trained on a specific dataset that may not represent:
   - All types of pneumonia
   - All patient demographics
   - All imaging equipment and protocols
   - Rare or unusual presentations

3. **No Clinical Context**: The model only analyzes images and does NOT consider:
   - Patient symptoms
   - Medical history
   - Physical examination findings
   - Laboratory results
   - Other diagnostic information

4. **Generalization Issues**: Performance may degrade on:
   - Different X-ray equipment
   - Different imaging protocols
   - Different patient populations
   - Images with artifacts or poor quality

### Technical Risks

- **Software Bugs**: The software may contain errors or bugs
- **Data Quality**: Results depend on image quality and proper formatting
- **Internet Dependency**: May require internet connection for some features
- **Privacy Concerns**: Uploaded images may be transmitted over networks
- **Version Changes**: Updates may alter behavior or results

## What You Should Do Instead

### For Patients

If you or someone you know has symptoms of pneumonia (fever, cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing):

1. **Seek Professional Medical Care**
   - Contact your doctor or healthcare provider
   - Visit an urgent care center or emergency room if severe
   - Call emergency services (911 in US) if life-threatening

2. **Get Proper Diagnosis**
   - Only qualified healthcare professionals can diagnose pneumonia
   - Diagnosis requires medical history, physical exam, and imaging
   - Additional tests (blood work, sputum culture) may be needed

3. **Follow Medical Advice**
   - Take prescribed medications as directed
   - Complete full course of antibiotics if prescribed
   - Attend follow-up appointments

**DO NOT** use PneumoScan to:
- Make medical decisions
- Delay seeking professional care
- Change or stop medications
- Self-diagnose any condition

### For Healthcare Professionals

This tool is NOT validated for clinical use. If you're interested in AI-assisted diagnosis:

1. Use only FDA-approved or appropriately certified medical AI tools
2. Ensure proper clinical validation and regulatory compliance
3. Maintain human oversight and clinical judgment
4. Follow your institution's protocols and guidelines
5. Consider this tool only for educational or research purposes

### For Researchers & Developers

If you want to use this code for research:

1. Ensure proper ethical approvals (IRB/ethics committee)
2. Use appropriate datasets with proper permissions
3. Validate thoroughly before any clinical consideration
4. Document limitations and potential biases
5. Never use real patient data without authorization
6. Follow all applicable regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

---

## Privacy & Data Handling

### What Happens to Uploaded Images

- Images are temporarily stored for processing
- Files are deleted after prediction (in current implementation)
- No long-term storage of uploaded images (by default)
- No personally identifiable information should be included

### Recommendations

- **DO NOT** upload images containing:
  - Patient names or identifiers
  - Medical record numbers
  - Dates of birth
  - Any protected health information (PHI)

- **DO** de-identify all images before upload if using for research
- **DO** comply with HIPAA, GDPR, and other privacy regulations
- **DO** use secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS) when deployed

## Regulatory Considerations

### United States (FDA)

This software has NOT been:
- Submitted to the FDA
- Cleared through 510(k) process
- Approved through PMA (Premarket Approval)

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias & Fairness

- The model may have biases based on training data
- Performance may vary across different populations
- Certain demographics may be under-represented
- Historical biases in medical data may be perpetuated

### Transparency

- Model decisions are not fully explainable
- "Black box" nature of deep learning
- Limited interpretability of predictions

### Accountability

- Humans must remain responsible for medical decisions
- AI should augment, not replace, clinical judgment
- Clear communication of AI limitations is essential

---

## When in Doubt, Consult a Professional

**ALWAYS prioritize professional medical care over any software tool.**

### Emergency Warning Signs (Seek Immediate Medical Attention)

- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Persistent chest pain or pressure
- Confusion or inability to wake
- Bluish lips or face
- High fever that won't respond to medication
- Severe or worsening cough
- Coughing up blood

**Call emergency services immediately if experiencing these symptoms.**
